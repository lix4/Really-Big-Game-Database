# Really-Big-Game-Database
This is my CSSE333 Introduction to Database's final project. It includes both frontend code and sql database script file of backend. 
We use python flask as the script language to handle the frontend and backend connection. 
For html file, we have django which can dynamically change html tags. 
For the backend, we use SQL database.
