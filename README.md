# Really-Big-Game-Database
This is my CSSE333 Introduction to Database's final project. It includes both frontend code and sql database script file of backend. 
We use python flask as the script language to handle the frontend and backend connection. 
For html file, we have django which can dynamically change html tags. 
For the backend, we use SQL database. The repository includes all of the database .sql script. The database of the project
is deleted at 02/23/2017 due to the end of this class.
